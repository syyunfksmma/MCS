To Infinity and Beyond!
New Features, Improvements, and Changes

Active Workspace 2312+

Active Workspace

• Active Workspace is a web-based client and user 
interface for Teamcenter that can run on any device with a 
web browser, such as a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop. 

It helps you create and manage data in your enterprise's 

•
product lifecycle management (PLM) system.

• The web interface shows you everything you need to get 
your work done quickly and easily.

• The image shows you the main work area and how it is 
tailored to fit your needs.

Fundamentals

• Navigation is easy and straightforward.

• The Home Page contains tiles that launch various 
commands, such as viewing your schedules, opening 
your Inbox, and managing your changes, as well as links 
to commonly-used functions and the search box.

Workflows

• Workflows are a series of required tasks, such as 
approvals (signoffs) and reviews, performed on an object, 
such as a part, document, or change.

• The workflow contains tasks related to the type of 
workflow launched for the object. 

• These tasks are automatically sent to the responsible 
participant’s Inbox.

• Once all the work is complete, the object is released 
from the workflow.

Change Management

• When a change is requested for an object, usually due to 
a problem found with it, it must go through a series of 
design revisions and approvals before the change is 
released.

• When you create a new change and submit it, a workflow 
is triggered that starts the process of tracking the work on 
the requested change.

User Interface

• For Teamcenter 2312, the Active Workspace user 
interface underwent several significant changes in 
terms of form and function.
• This includes changes in the Home page and global 
navigation, the primary toolbar, page headers and 
layouts, folders, and design and behavior changes for 
some UI elements.
• Accordingly, we have revised the documentation to 
include updated graphics and videos to orient you to the 
interface changes.

User Environment

• The properties displayed in the pop-
up can vary depending on your group 
and role.
• For example, if only one workspace 
is configured for your role, the 
Workspace property is not present.

Memberships

• Your user profile page enables you 
to provide information about yourself 
that other users can see and set 
several defaults and preferences that 
are applied when you work in Active 
Workspace.
• This topic explains how to access 
the page and describes the most 
common settings that new users may 
want to adjust.

Task Panel

• Some commands open a 
task panel. Typically, these 
panels display over the top 
of the information in the 
work area. Examples 
include Add panel, Create 
Change panel, and Trace 
Link panel.

Move and Resize 
Panels

• As you work with data objects, you may 
open panels to perform your task.
• Some panels, such as the Information 
panel, can be undocked and moved 
around the browser window.
• When undocked they can also be 
resized.
• When you re-dock a panel to return it to 
its default location, the next time you 
undock the panel, it returns to its last 
undocked size and position.

Table Columns

• Create, save, and open different column 
arrangements to control which columns 
appear in tables and trees. When viewing 
a table or tree, the default column 
arrangement appears if you have not 
previously viewed the table. If you viewed 
the table previously, you see the last 
column arrangement used. You can open 
a different column arrangement, or add 
more columns to a table you are currently 
viewing to create a new column 
arrangement.

Context Menu

• Access various commands in the 
context of the items that you are 
working with by right-clicking the 
items.

Markup

Layout Manager

• Since the 2312 release and continuing in this 
release, page layout information is stored locally.

• The default layout configured on the server is 
applied if your browser or device does not have 
local page layout information stored.

• Once you select a layout, it is displayed each 
time you return to the same page until you select 
a different layout.

If you open that same page's URL in a different 

•
browser or device, the default layout is applied, 
and new local layout information is stored for that 
URL.

LOV as Table

• Previously, dropdown lists of values (LOVs) 
showed only the Value.

• Some drop-down lists now appear as a table 
rather than as a list of single values. 

• You can search for values in these tables.

• As an administrator, to configure this option, a 
new renderingHint named lovTable must be 
appended in the stylesheet to a property that has 
an LOV attached to it.

• <property name="aw2+LongString_LOV" 
renderingHint="lovTable"/>

Toolbar

• Starting in 2406, properties and 
details other than the name of the 
revision may not appear on the toolbar 
when the Active Workspace window is 
not in full-screen mode or if the space 
preceding the breadcrumbs area has 
shrunken in size.

• Depending on the size of your 
browser window and display resolution, 
the More... command may be 
displayed on the toolbar.

• By clicking this command, the 
additional properties and details of the 
object appear.

Banner

• You can now create a banner along the top 
of the Active Workspace user interface. Use 
this banner to alert your users of future 
downtime, alert them of potential issues, 
and so on.

• You must set values of the AWC_Banner 
site preference and specify the message 
text, type, and beginning date and time. You 
can optionally set an ending time or a 
duration.

• There are three types of messages that 
you can create.

XRT Editor

• Before, the editor did not navigate 
injected style sheets.
• You needed to manually search for 
them and edit them separately. 
• Now, when modifying style sheets 
using the XRT Editor you can navigate 
a tree which represents the main style 
sheet and all of the injected style 
sheets automatically.

Commands

• 2406, Several common 
commands previously 
found only on the primary 
toolbar are now also 
available in more areas of 
the user interface where 
they are contextually 
relevant.

Content

• The Content tab displays the content of a 
structure. The following diagram shows the 
configurable parts of the Content tab.

Revert

• The revert functionality applies to those ECNs 
that include redline changes.

• When a user is authoring a BOM in the context 
of an ECN and has either replaced, removed, or 
added a new line item, sometimes unintentional 
changes can occur.

• An incorrect entry might unintentionally be 
made.

• The revert functionality lets you return a redline 
change back to its original impacted version.

• You can revert items in BOMs with and without 
effectivity dates applied.

Compare 
Elements

Compare 
Properties

• You can compare common properties of 

objects.

• Select multiple objects from the list.

Merge

• You can compare and merge 
unincorporated changes to existing 
designs.
• Through this process, you can 
integrate an emergency released ECN 
into an in-progress ECN by viewing 
both structures side-by-side and 
selecting updated items to merge.

Excel 
Round Trip

• When exporting to Excel, you 
can now choose to use the existing 
columns displayed in the structure 
window or specify your own with 
the standard Arrange user 
interface.

• This is done by selecting a 
Custom template from the Export 
to Excel drop down and following 
the Arrange user interface.

• You can continue to select from 
the preconfigured list of Excel 
export templates.

Reports

• You can create a dashboard report for 
structure readiness to gather data about 
the components of the selected structure.

• The following is an example of how to 
create a structure readiness report.

• After creating the report definition, you 
can search and select a product structure, 
and generate a report.

• This report traverses the selected 
structure to display information about its 
components, such as, their release 
status, how many of them are in process, 
the date released, and the date modified.

Dashboard

• Once a report is open, you can drill 
down to view more specific data.

My 
Dashboard

My Dashboard is a personalized list of 
your favorite reports. It contains Active 
Summary reports.

To open the report, hover over the report 
title until a link appears, and click the title 
link to open it.

Default Template

• In case users from different groups 
want to see a different default 
template for an object, you can define 
groups/subgroups for a template.
• You can use the existing preference 
WorkspaceObject_default_workflow
_template. This preference can be 
enhanced to support multiple values 
with the format 
GroupName::Template Name or 
Subgroup.Group::TemplateName.

Workflows

In a workflow, if a task's Start action fails 
due to an error, the parent task appears in 
the Inbox. You must then complete the 
task after resolving the issue.

Starting in 2406, in such cases, the error is 
displayed on the parent task and identifies 
the child task that includes the error.

The child task opens automatically in the 
Diagram's graphical view on the 
Workflow tab.

Auto Layout

Fixed Layout

Show Children

Inbox

To help you reassign tasks, manage 
surrogates, or see if someone is out of 
the office, you can view their profile 
page.

For example, if a workflow is not 
progressing because a particular user 
has not responded, you can view 
whether that user is out of the office.

As a privileged user, you can also 
access their inbox to reassign a task.

Guided 
Navigation

• The Teamcenter Assistant suggests the 
next possible actions to perform and 
provides the relevant data required to 
perform them.
• These suggestions are based on the 
context, history, and usage frequency of 
actions performed by other previous users 
belonging to the same role and group.
• You can use the Tutor Mode to train the 
Assistant to learn a preferred way to 
complete a task.

3D Tab

• Earlier, to display a model in the 
viewer, you had to click the 3D tab.
• Now, to display the model in the 
viewer, you must switch to 3D from 
Details by clicking 3D in the list of 
available views.

Universal 
Viewer

• Use the universal viewer 
to view object 
attachments.
• The universal viewer 
appears in an object's 
Overview tab if there are 
attachments for the 
object, or in a workflow 
task's Overview tab if 
there is an associated 
attachment.

3D Viewer

• Earlier, you could move or resize only a 
few panels in the 3D viewer.
• Now, you can undock and move all 
panels around the browser window to your 
desired location. They can also be resized 
to take up less space. This helps you get 
the best screen layout for your working 
style.
• Parts in the exploded view in the 3D 
viewer can be captured in context, with 
the 3D data, within snapshots.

Viewer Options

• After opening an assembly, without 
opening the 3D viewer, you can access 
and alter available properties in 
Viewer Options.
• You can therefore change viewer 
settings before opening the 3D viewer, 
especially if the settings are likely to 
relaunch or reload the viewer.
