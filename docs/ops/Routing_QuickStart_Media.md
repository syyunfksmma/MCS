# Routing Quick-start Media Plan

<!-- Embed Location: docs portal ▸ Media Library ▸ Routing Quick Start -->

## 1. Objective
Produce a 3–4 minute quick-start video (exported as MP4) and a 90-second GIF summarizing routing creation, version management, and approvals. Deliverables will be embedded on the docs portal and distributed via LMS.

## 2. Storyboard Outline
1. **Intro (0:00–0:20)** — Title card, narrator introduces routing workspace and highlights prerequisites.
2. **Create Routing (0:20–1:10)** — Demonstrate adding operations, applying templates, and saving. Capture cursor focus on validation toasts.
3. **Attach Files (1:10–1:45)** — Showcase drag-and-drop upload, checksum display, and mandatory file indicators.
4. **Version Management (1:45–2:30)** — Open version history, compare revisions, and mark a version as Ready.
5. **Approval Workflow (2:30–3:15)** — Submit for approval, show notification feed, and highlight approver comment thread.
6. **Wrap-up (3:15–3:30)** — Present resource links: user guide, support FAQ, admin handbook.

## 3. Narration Script (Draft)
- *“Welcome to MCMS Routing. In this quick tour we’ll create a routing, attach required CAM outputs, and manage approvals.”*
- *“Start in Explorer ▸ Routing. Select a product revision, then click **New Routing** to load the operation template.”*
- *“Uploads finish once the checksum turns green. Missing mandatory files trigger the Ready checklist below the attachments grid.”*
- *“Every save creates a version. Use **Compare** to review operation deltas and confirm timestamps before requesting approval.”*
- *“When you submit for approval, the approver receives a worklist notification and can respond in-line. Keep collaboration notes concise.”*
- *“That’s the tour. Visit the user guide or admin handbook for deeper workflows.”*

## 4. Capture & Editing Notes
- Recording tool: ScreenFlow 10 (fallback: OBS Studio 30.2).
- Resolution: 1920×1080 @ 60 FPS; export 12 Mbps H.264.
- Overlay annotations: highlight cursor path during approval submission.
- Caption file: generate WebVTT via Descript and upload to LMS.
