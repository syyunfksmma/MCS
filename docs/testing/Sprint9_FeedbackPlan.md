# Sprint 9 Feedback Collection Plan â€” Folder Sync Latency & UI Clarity

## Channels
- Teams channel `#mcms-uat` with pinned form (Microsoft Forms) capturing latency observations.
- In-app feedback banner (storybook variant) pointing to `/feedback` route (feature flag `feature.feedback-banner`).

## Survey Questions
1. "How long did offline package sync take after approval?" (dropdown: <5m, 5-10m, >10m)
2. "Was the Explorer ribbon/quick menu self-explanatory?" (Likert 1-5)
3. Free-form comments (prompt for confusing labels, missing data).

## Data Handling
- Responses exported daily to `artifacts/testing/feedback/sprint9_feedback.csv` via script `scripts/automation/export-feedback.ps1` (to be scheduled nightly).
- Severity tagging: Codex triage within 24h; backlog items created in `MCMS_TaskList.md` (Phase 5+).

## Mapping to Backlog
